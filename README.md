Problem Overview
-Modeled a cutting tool as a 1D fin with conduction and convection
-Fit 𝑘(𝜙) to a quadratic and h(V) to a power law from provided datasets
-Discretized the governing ODE with finite differences; applied Dirichlet base and Robin tip boundary conditions
-Computed temperature distribution, max temperature, and max gradient; performed a parameter sweep and exported results to Excel
